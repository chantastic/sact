- Create simple 1-page mock in tldraw
- Next legitimately has my favorite raw starter
  - There's already dark-mode light mode text and backdrop setup (globals.css)
  - Google Fonts are already setup, so I can easily grab the one I want for this project
  - Quiclky setup the Metadata I care about for this tiny project
  - And get to work styling with tailwind…
- I want a simple layout optimized for my phone but doesn't look terrible on larger screens. For that, I…
  - Use 100% of the available viewport with `dvh` and `dvw`. This is a dynamic viewport that, unlike `vh` take into account mobile browser chrome. Which is great
    - Tailwind doesn't have values for this but I can use their bracket syntax to provide literal values — very nice.
  - Then I have a little centered element that responds minimally to the orientation of the window
  - One little hack I do with tailwind is to use string literals. i can minimally organize my classes without using having to extract them in any way. This isn't great. The only real downside is that you're opting out of prettier for formatting
- Draw the rest of the UI Owl
  - I always like to start with the markup.
    - `main` to wrap mark the main section of our page.
    - An `ol` ("ordered list") of events
      - We'll render this as `grid`
      - And, in lieu of state, we'll provide a 19-item array filed with null.
      - Each item is a `li` ("list time")
        - Because our button content is an emoji, I'd like to describe it with an `aria-label`
        - I'll use a static one for incomplete now and we'll come back to it.
    - finally we have our action buttons.
      - because these use emoji, we have an aria label to provide a discription
- Ok. That's the visual change I'm gonna show you. You have to check out the final app to see the rest.
- Let's jump into the coding.
